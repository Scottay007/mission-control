`AI-powered diagnostic tools for every rider and driver`

### Description
Mission Control is a free, AI-powered vehicle intelligence platform for Harley riders, car owners, truckers, e-bike riders, and scooter owners. 41 free diagnostic tools, AI chat trained on 5 platforms, vehicle garage, and community forum — one dashboard.

**Free tools include:** DTC databases, diagnostic flowcharts, HOS tracker, pre-trip checklist, battery calculator, tire calculator, fuel log, unit converter, and more. AI Diagnostic Chat gives 3 free queries/day. No login required for most tools.

Built with Next.js, Supabase, Stripe, and Claude AI. Solo developer. Baton Rouge, LA.

### Maker's First Comment
Hey PH! 👋 I'm a solo dev from Baton Rouge who built this because I was tired of Googling DTC codes at 11pm in my garage. Started as a Harley tool, grew into 5 platforms with 41 tools. The free tier is genuinely useful — not a teaser. Every diagnostic tool works without signing up. Would love your feedback!

### Gallery Descriptions

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
Every vehicle owner hits the same wall: "What does this code mean?" "Is it safe to drive?" "Am I getting ripped off?"

I built 41 tools to answer those questions — for free.

**Tweet 3 (AI):**
The AI Diagnostic Chat is the killer feature. Pick your platform. Describe your issue in plain English. Get expert-level guidance trained on your specific vehicle type. 3 free queries/day.

**Tweet 4 (Garage):**
Vehicle Garage: Track multiple vehicles, log service history with costs, monitor fuel economy, get maintenance reminders. A service logbook in the cloud.

**Tweet 5 (Stack):**
Built with: Next.js 15, Supabase, Stripe, Claude AI, Vercel, Kit, Tailwind. Solo dev. ~13,000 lines. Dark theme throughout.

**Tweet 6 (CTA):**
Launch week: 20% off annual with code LAUNCH20. But the free tier is where most should start — 41 tools, 3 AI queries/day, 1 vehicle. Free forever.
