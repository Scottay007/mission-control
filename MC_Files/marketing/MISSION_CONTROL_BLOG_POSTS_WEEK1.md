## Post 1: What Does P0131 Mean on a Harley?

P0131 = front O2 sensor reading low voltage. Common on Twin Cam and Milwaukee-Eight. ECM expects 0.1-0.9V oscillation; triggers when stuck below 0.3V.

**Causes:** Faulty O2 sensor (most common at 30K+ miles), exhaust leak at header gasket, wiring damage/corrosion, ECM issue (rare).

**Diagnosis:** Visual inspect wiring and connector. Check for exhaust leaks. Multimeter on sensor voltage while running. If flat below 0.3V, replace sensor.

**Cost:** $50-150 part, 30-60 min labor. Straightforward DIY on most models.

## Post 3: E-Bike Battery Health — Maximize Your Range

Most e-bikes use lithium-ion. 48V/14Ah = 672Wh. Higher Wh = more range.

**Maximize range:** Proper tire pressure (+15%), eco mode on flats, pedal on hills, clean chain (less motor load).

**Battery care:** Store at 60-80%. Never charge below freezing. Don't leave on charger for days. Bring indoors in extreme temps. Expect 300-500 cycles.

## Post 4: OBD-II Codes Explained — Beginner's Guide

OBD-II is standardized on every car since 1996. When the check engine light comes on, the ECU stores a diagnostic code.

**Code format:** P0420 — P=Powertrain, 0=Generic, 4=Emissions, 20=Specific fault.

**Categories:** P=Powertrain, B=Body, C=Chassis, U=Network.

**Most common:** P0420 (cat efficiency), P0171 (lean), P0300 (misfire), P0442 (EVAP leak), P0128 (thermostat).

**What to do:** Auto parts stores scan for free. Look up the code. Steady light = schedule service. Flashing = stop driving.

## Post 5: Pre-Trip Inspection Checklist for CDL Drivers

A proper pre-trip takes 15-20 minutes. It's required by DOT and protects you.

**Key areas:** Engine compartment (oil, coolant, belts), cab (mirrors, wipers, gauges, emergency equip), exterior (lights, tires, lug nuts), coupling (fifth wheel, kingpin, air lines), brakes (air pressure, leak rate, parking brake).

**Pro tips:** Same order every time builds muscle memory. Document everything. Report defects immediately.
